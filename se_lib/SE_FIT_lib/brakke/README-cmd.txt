A selection of Evolver commands for your edification.  Consult remarks at
the top of each file for further information and instructions on use.
Use with caution; no attempt has been made to bulletproof these.

Note: These scripts do not necessarily take advantage of all the latest
Evolver features, and if I were writing them from scratch now they might
turn out quite different.
